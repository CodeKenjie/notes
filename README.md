## Hello this is just a simple Notepad project nothing special. Created using in C++
Why did I wrote this abominataion? Simple, one day, I was looking for a light weight notepad to download, then i realize "why not make my own notepad" so i decided to make my own notepad, there is a lot of thing i need to improve tho. it's not perfect but it's good enough :)

- **it runs only in your terminal very minimal**
- *had a lot of fun making this very simple project*
- future upgrades, idk probably....
- Terminal notepad
### Guide
- Download the main.cpp or just the note if you just wanna use the note. i believe it works on Window im using ARCH btw.
- then, just run ./notes in your terminal
- you can modify it if you want its not that good anyway -_-

### *Todo*
- [1] Write properly
- [2] Edit note properly
- [3] Invalid index crashes it (deleting all notes.. :p)
- [4] Add tags and search note by tags/title?? maybe.. I don't have a lot of notes soo I did not put one
>>I'm planning on rewriting this using C, just for the fun of it
